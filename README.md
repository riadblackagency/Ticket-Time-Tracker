# Ticket Time Tracker

A lightweight, browser-based time tracking app. Create tasks, start/stop timers, and keep a local history of tracked time directly in your browser using local storage.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (no build step required).
2. Add a task name and click **Add task**.
3. Use the play/pause button to control timing for each task. Reset clears the tracked time for that task.

All data is stored locally in your browser and remains available between sessions.
